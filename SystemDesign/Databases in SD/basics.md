# ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: **Databases in System Design**

Every large-scale system **relies heavily on databases**.
The challenge: how to design them so they donâ€™t become the **bottleneck**.

---

## 1. SQL vs NoSQL

### ðŸ”¹ SQL (Relational Databases)

- Structured data, with tables and relations (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Best when data has **relations** (e.g., Banking, E-commerce Orders).

âš¡ Example: Like a **library catalog** â†’ every book must be in proper category & format.

---

### ðŸ”¹ NoSQL (Non-Relational)

- Flexible schema (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB).
- Good for **scaling horizontally**.
- Best for **large, unstructured, fast-growing data** (logs, IoT, social media).

âš¡ Example: Like a **notebook** â†’ you can write freely without strict rules.

---

## 2. Replication

What if one database server fails? â†’ **System crashes** ðŸ˜±

Solution: **Replication** â†’ copy database across multiple servers.

- Master-Slave (Primary-Replica):

  - **Primary** handles writes.
  - **Replicas** handle reads.

- If primary fails â†’ a replica is promoted.

âš¡ Real-world analogy: Think of a **main teacher (primary)** writing notes on the board, and all **students (replicas)** copying them.

---

## 3. Sharding (Partitioning Data)

What if the database gets **too big**? One machine canâ€™t handle it.

Solution: **Sharding** â†’ split data across multiple databases.

- Example:

  - Users Aâ€“M â†’ DB1
  - Users Nâ€“Z â†’ DB2

âš¡ Real-world analogy: Instead of keeping **all books in one giant library**, split them across **multiple libraries by subject**.

---

## 4. CAP Theorem

When scaling databases, we face trade-offs:

- **C â†’ Consistency**: Every user sees the same data.
- **A â†’ Availability**: System always responds, even if some servers fail.
- **P â†’ Partition Tolerance**: Works even if network breaks between servers.

âš¡ Rule: You can pick **only 2 out of 3**.

Example:

- Banking â†’ **Consistency + Partition Tolerance** (must be correct, even if slow).
- Social Media â†’ **Availability + Partition Tolerance** (better to show old data than fail).

---

## 5. Indexing

Databases get slow when tables grow.
Indexing = making a **search-friendly shortcut**.

- Example:

  - Without index â†’ search like reading a whole book.
  - With index â†’ like using the bookâ€™s **table of contents**.

---

âœ… So now you know the **database-level tricks** for scalability:

- SQL vs NoSQL
- Replication
- Sharding
- CAP theorem
- Indexing

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: We can go into **System Components (Message Queues, Microservices, API Gateways, etc.)**, OR we can **design a real system (like Instagram/WhatsApp/URL shortener) using all concepts so far**.
