# Data Types in Python

# 1. Integer
# Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
# Example:
age = 25
print(f"Age: {age}")

# Real-world usage: Counting items, age calculation, etc.

# 2. Float
# Floats are numbers with a decimal point.
# Example:
price = 19.99
print(f"Price: {price}")

# Real-world usage: Financial calculations, measurements, etc.

# 3. String
# Strings are sequences of characters, used to store text.
# Example:
name = "John Doe"
print(f"Name: {name}")

# Real-world usage: Storing names, addresses, any textual information.

# 4. Boolean
# Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
# Example:
is_student = True
print(f"Is student: {is_student}")

# Real-world usage: Conditional statements, flags, etc.

# 5. List
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(f"Fruits: {fruits}")

# Real-world usage: Storing collections of items, such as a list of users.

# 6. Tuple
# Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed).
# Example:
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}")

# Real-world usage: Storing fixed collections of items, such as geographic coordinates.

# 7. Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# Example:
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(f"Person: {person}")

# Real-world usage: Storing related data, such as user profiles.

# 8. Set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable, but cannot have duplicate values.
# Example:
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}
print(f"Unique numbers: {unique_numbers}")

# Real-world usage: Storing unique items, such as a set of unique IDs.

# 9. NoneType
# NoneType represents the absence of a value.
# Example:
nothing = None
print(f"Nothing: {nothing}")

# Real-world usage: Default values, placeholders for optional data.
