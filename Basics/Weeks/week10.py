# ## 🧪 What is a Virtual Environment?

# A **virtual environment** is a **separate, isolated workspace** for your Python project. It has its own **Python interpreter** and **installed libraries**, so your project won’t interfere with the global Python installation or other projects.

# ---

# ## 🚨 Why You Should Use a Virtual Environment

# Without virtual environments:

# * All packages are installed globally.
# * Different projects may need different versions of the same library (e.g., FastAPI 0.78 vs 0.100).
# * Conflicts happen often, breaking your code.

# With virtual environments:
# ✅ Each project has its own dependencies.
# ✅ No conflicts between libraries of different projects.
# ✅ Cleaner, more professional project structure.

# ## 🛠️ How to Create and Use One (Step-by-Step)

# ### 🧱 Step 1: Install `virtualenv` (or use built-in `venv`)

# * **Option 1 (recommended):** Use built-in `venv`
# * **Option 2:** Install `virtualenv` (older alternative)

# ```bash
# pip install virtualenv  # optional
# ```

# ---

# ### 🧪 Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

# In your project folder:

# ```bash
# # Using built-in venv
# python -m venv venv

# # OR using virtualenv
# virtualenv venv
# ```

# This creates a folder named `venv/` that holds the isolated environment.

# ---

# ### 🚀 Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

# * **Windows:**

# ```bash
# venv\Scripts\activate
# ```

# * **Mac/Linux:**

# ```bash
# source venv/bin/activate
# ```

# > After activation, you'll see `(venv)` in your terminal, which means you're now working *inside* the virtual environment.

# ---

# ### 📦 Step 4: Install Project Libraries (like FastAPI)

# ```bash
# pip install fastapi uvicorn
# ```

# All packages will now install **only inside this project’s environment**.

# ---

# ### 📄 Step 5: Freeze Requirements

# If you want to share your project or re-install it later:

# ```bash
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# ```

# This creates a list of installed packages so others (or future you) can run:

# ```bash
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# ```

# ---

# ### ❌ Step 6: Deactivate the Environment

# When you're done:

# ```bash
# deactivate
# ```

# This returns you to your system’s normal Python.

# | Feature                 | Without Virtual Env | With Virtual Env               |
# | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
# | Dependency Conflicts    | ❌ Yes               | ✅ No                           |
# | Clean Project Structure | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                          |
# | Easy Collaboration      | ❌ Difficult         | ✅ Easy with `requirements.txt` |
