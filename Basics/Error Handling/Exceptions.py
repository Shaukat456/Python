# ## üß† What is Error Handling?

# When your program encounters something unexpected ‚Äî like a wrong input, a missing file, or a math error ‚Äî it stops (crashes) and shows a **traceback**.

# But with **error handling**, you can catch those errors and decide what to do next ‚Äî like showing a message instead of crashing.

# ---

# ## üîç Real-Life Analogy

# Imagine you're withdrawing cash from an ATM.
# If there's **no internet**, it **doesn't crash** ‚Äî it shows:

# > "Sorry, the transaction cannot be completed right now."

# Python‚Äôs error handling works similarly ‚Äî instead of crashing, you **gracefully handle** errors.

# ## ‚úÖ The Basic Structure: `try` / `except`

# ```python
# try:
#     # risky code here
#     x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#     result = 10 / x
#     print("Result:", result)
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("You can't divide by zero!")
# except ValueError:
#     print("Please enter a valid number!")
# ```

# ### üîÅ Explanation:

# * `try`: Run the code that **might** cause an error.
# * `except`: Catch a specific error and handle it.
# * You can catch **multiple** types of errors.

# ## üìö Common Exceptions in Python

# | Error               | When It Happens                                       |
# | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
# | `ZeroDivisionError` | Dividing by zero                                      |
# | `ValueError`        | Wrong type of value (e.g., converting `"abc"` to int) |
# | `TypeError`         | Incompatible types (e.g., `"5" + 2`)                  |
# | `IndexError`        | List index out of range                               |
# | `KeyError`          | Accessing a missing key in a dictionary               |
# | `FileNotFoundError` | Trying to open a file that doesn‚Äôt exist              |

# ## üõ† Real-World Example: Handling File Read

# ```python
# try:
#     with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
#         content = file.read()
#         print(content)
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("The file was not found. Please check the name.")
# ```

# ### üß† Analogy:

# Just like a librarian tells you a book isn‚Äôt available rather than quitting their job, Python tells you the file isn't there instead of crashing.

# ---

# ## üîÅ Using `else` and `finally`

# ```python
# try:
#     num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#     print("You entered:", num)
# except ValueError:
#     print("That's not a number.")
# else:
#     print("No error occurred!")
# finally:
#     print("This will run no matter what.")
# ```

# ### ‚úÖ Summary:

# * `try`: code that might break
# * `except`: what to do if it breaks
# * `else`: runs **if no exception**
# * `finally`: **always** runs (cleanup, closing files, etc.)

# ## üß™ Raising Your Own Errors (Advanced)

# ```python
# age = -5
# if age < 0:
#     raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
# ```

# You can use `raise` to throw an error if **your custom rule is violated**.

# üß† Use case: Web forms, authentication systems, scientific inputs, etc.

# ## üß© Capstone Challenge (All Concepts)

# ```python
# def divide(a, b):
#     try:
#         result = a / b
#     except ZeroDivisionError:
#         return "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
#     except TypeError:
#         return "Error: Invalid types"
#     else:
#         return f"Success: {result}"
#     finally:
#         print("End of operation")

# print(divide(10, 2))       # Success
# print(divide(10, 0))       # Division error
# print(divide("10", "2"))   # Type error
# ```
