# Here’s a beginner-friendly and **non-animal, non-car based** explanation of **class** and **object** in Python — using clear analogies and real-world examples 👇

# ---

# ## 🧱 **What is a Class?**

# A **class** is like a **blueprint** or **template** for creating something.
# It **defines what attributes (data)** and **methods (functions)** every created object should have — but it’s **not a real thing by itself** until you make an object from it.

# ### 🔧 **Analogy: Form or Template**

# Think of a **"Google Form"** for student registration:

# * The form has fields: name, email, roll number.
# * But until someone **fills the form**, it’s just a **template**.

# ➡️ That **form template = class**
# ➡️ A **filled form = object (instance)**

# ---

# ## 🧍‍♂️ **What is an Object?**

# An **object** is a **real instance** of a class — a concrete version that holds **actual values**.

# Once you create an object from a class, it **gets its own data**, but it still **follows the rules defined in the class**.

# ---

# ## 🧪 **Python Example: User Registration**

# ```python
# # Class (blueprint/template)
# class Student:
#     def __init__(self, name, roll):
#         self.name = name
#         self.roll = roll

#     def introduce(self):
#         print(f"My name is {self.name} and my roll number is {self.roll}.")
# ```

# Now let’s create **objects** using the class:

# ```python
# # Objects (instances)
# student1 = Student("John", 21)
# student2 = Student("david", 12)

# student1.introduce()
# student2.introduce()
# ```

# ### 🖨️ Output:

# ```
# My name is John and my roll number is 21.
# My name is David and my roll number is 12.
# ```

# ## 🔄 Class vs Object — Quick Comparison

# | Concept    | Class                          | Object                        |
# | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
# | Definition | Blueprint/template             | Real instance made from class |
# | Exists?    | Not real until used            | Real and usable               |
# | Example    | “Student form”                 | A filled form for Fatima/Umer |
# | Contains   | Methods, variables (but empty) | Actual data and behavior      |

# ---

# ## 🧠 Extra Analogy: Design & Execution

# 🎨 **Class = App Design Document**
# 📱 **Object = Working App**

# You can design how your app should look and behave in Figma (class),
# But it only becomes real when you **build and run it (object)**.

# ---


# ## 🔑 `self` Keyword — **Think: “This Particular One”**

# ### 📦 **Analogy: Delivery Form**

# Imagine a delivery company. Each parcel has a **form** with:

# * recipient name
# * address
# * mobile number

# Now, when a worker scans a parcel, the system must know:

# > “This parcel goes to *this person*, at *this address*.”

# That's what `self` means:

# > It refers to **the current instance (object)** — “this particular one”.

# ---

# ### 🧪 Python Example:

# ```python
# class Parcel:
#     def __init__(self, recipient, address):
#         self.recipient = recipient
#         self.address = address

#     def deliver(self):
#         print(f"Delivering to {self.recipient} at {self.address}")
# ```

# Now if we create two parcels:

# ```python
# p1 = Parcel("Areeba", "Karachi")
# p2 = Parcel("Hamza", "Lahore")

# p1.deliver()  # Uses p1's data
# p2.deliver()  # Uses p2's data
# ```

# 🔁 `self.recipient` is like saying:

# > “From *this* object, give me the recipient’s name.”

# ---

# ## ⚙️ `__init__` Method — **Think: Setup or First-Time Configuration**

# ### 🖥️ **Analogy: New Account Setup**

# When you create a new email account, you fill out:

# * Name
# * Password
# * Recovery email

# This happens **once at the start** to set everything up.

# That’s what `__init__` does:

# > It runs **automatically** when you create a new object. It sets up the object’s initial data.

# ---

# ### 🧪 Python Example:

# ```python
# class EmailAccount:
#     def __init__(self, user, password):
#         self.user = user
#         self.password = password

#     def show_info(self):
#         print(f"Account: {self.user}")
# ```

# ```python
# acc1 = EmailAccount("umer786", "secure123")
# acc1.show_info()
# ```

# 📌 The `__init__` method was automatically called when we wrote `EmailAccount(...)`. It set the values for `user` and `password` for that specific object.

# ---

# ## 🔄 Combined Meaning

# ### When you write:

# ```python
# acc1 = EmailAccount("umer786", "secure123")
# ```

# Here’s what’s secretly happening:

# 1. Python **creates a new object** (`acc1`)
# 2. It **calls the `__init__` method**
# 3. Inside `__init__`, `self` refers to `acc1`
# 4. It assigns `user` and `password` to `acc1`’s internal data

# | Keyword    | What it does                                   | Analogy                              |
# | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
# | `self`     | Refers to the current object (like "this one") | This parcel / this email account     |
# | `__init__` | Initializes the object (auto-called once)      | Account setup / delivery form filled |
