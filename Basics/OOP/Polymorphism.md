# 🔑 **What is Polymorphism?**

- **Polymorphism** = “Many Forms”
- It allows **one method, operator, or object** to behave differently depending on the context.
- It makes code **flexible, reusable, and scalable**.

---

# 🎯 **Real-World Analogy**

1. **Person Example**

   - A person can be a **student at school**,
   - a **child at home**,
   - and an **employee at work**.
     👉 The _same person_ behaves **differently** depending on the situation.

2. **Shape Example**

   - Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle are all **shapes**.
   - They share a common behavior: `area()`.
   - But each calculates the area **differently**.

# 🐍 **Polymorphism in Python**

### 1️⃣ **Polymorphism with Functions & Methods**

```python
# Same function name, different behavior

print(len("OpenAI"))       # counts characters
print(len([1, 2, 3, 4]))   # counts list items
print(len({"a": 1, "b": 2}))  # counts dictionary keys
```

✅ Same function `len()` works on **string, list, dict** differently.

---

### 2️⃣ **Polymorphism with Classes (Method Overriding)**

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof Woof")

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow Meow")


animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]

for animal in animals:
    animal.sound()   # Calls sound() depending on the object
```

✅ Output:

```
Woof Woof
Meow Meow
Some generic animal sound
```

👉 Same method name `sound()`, but **different behavior** depending on the object.

---

### 3️⃣ **Polymorphism with Inheritance + super()**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        print("Vehicle is moving")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Car drives on roads")

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Boat sails on water")

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Plane flies in the sky")


vehicles = [Car(), Boat(), Plane()]

for v in vehicles:
    v.move()
```

✅ Output:

```
Car drives on roads
Boat sails on water
Plane flies in the sky
```

👉 **One interface (`move`) → multiple implementations.**

---

### 4️⃣ **Operator Overloading (Special Methods)**

Polymorphism also works with **operators**.

```python
print(10 + 5)       # Integer addition
print("AI" + " ML") # String concatenation
print([1, 2] + [3]) # List concatenation
```

👉 Same operator `+`, but behaves differently depending on data type.

We can even **customize operators** in classes:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages):
        self.pages = pages

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.pages + other.pages

book1 = Book(100)
book2 = Book(150)

print("Total pages:", book1 + book2)
```

✅ Output:

```
Total pages: 250
```

---

# 🏭 **Real-World Use Cases of Polymorphism**

1. **GUI Frameworks** – A button, dropdown, and textbox all have `draw()` method but behave differently.
2. **Payment Gateways** – CreditCard, PayPal, and Crypto all have `pay()` but implementation varies.
3. **Game Development** – Different characters (`attack()`, `move()`) act differently.
4. **Machine Learning Models** – `.fit()` and `.predict()` behave differently for SVM, Decision Tree, or Neural Network.

---

# ✅ **Conclusion**

- **Polymorphism = Same interface, many implementations**.
- Achieved through:

  - Method overriding (inheritance)
  - Method overloading (not direct in Python but can simulate)
  - Operator overloading (`__add__`, `__str__`, etc.)

- Makes systems **scalable, maintainable, and flexible**.
