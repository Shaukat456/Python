# # ## 🧠 What is a Module?

# # A **module** is just a **file** that contains Python code — **functions**, **variables**, and **classes** — which you can use in other programs by importing it.

# # > 📂 Any Python file with a `.py` extension is a module.

# # ---

# # ## 📦 Why use modules?

# # ### Real-world analogy:

# # Imagine a **toolbox**. Instead of keeping every tool (screwdriver, hammer, etc.) in your pocket, you organize them in a toolbox.

# # In coding:

# # * You keep your tools (functions, classes) in a **module**
# # * Then you **import** only what you need

# # ---

# # ## ✅ Built-in Modules

# # Python comes with many built-in modules like:

# # | Module     | Purpose                        |
# # | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
# # | `math`     | Math operations                |
# # | `random`   | Generate random numbers        |
# # | `datetime` | Deal with dates and times      |
# # | `os`       | Interact with operating system |
# # | `sys`      | Access system-specific params  |

# # ### Example:

# # ```python
# import math

# print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4.0
# # ```

# # ---

# # ## 🧩 Custom Modules (your own .py file)

# # ### Step-by-step:

# # 1. **Create a Python file** called `utils.py`

# # ```python
# # # utils.py

# def greet(name):
#     return f"Hello, {name}!"
# # ```

# # 2. **Use it in another file**

# # ```python
# # # main.py

# import utils

# print(utils.greet("Ali"))  # Output: Hello, Ali!
# # ```

# # > This is how teams separate code into modules like `auth.py`, `db.py`, `email.py`, etc.

# # ## 🎯 Ways to Import

# # | Syntax                         | Use Case                               |
# # | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
# # | `import module`                | General usage                          |
# # | `import module as alias`       | Shorter reference                      |
# # | `from module import something` | Import specific part                   |
# # | `from module import *`         | Imports everything (⚠ not recommended) |

# # ### Example:

# # ```python
# # from math import pi, sqrt

# print(pi)        # 3.14159
# print(sqrt(9))   # 3.0
# # ```

# # ---

# # ## 📁 Organizing Modules in Folders (Packages)

# # If you have a folder:

# # ```
# # project/
# # ├── __init__.py
# # ├── math_utils.py
# # └── string_utils.py
# # ```

# # You can import like this:

# # ```python
# # from project.math_utils import add
# # ```

# # > `__init__.py` turns the folder into a "package" Python can recognize.

# # ---

# # ## 🛠 Real-world Use Case: Calculator Project

# # 1. `math_utils.py` → basic math functions
# # 2. `main.py` → imports `math_utils` and uses it

# # ---

# # ## 🧪 Practice Task for You

# # ### Create your own module:

# # 1. File: `shapes.py`

# # ```python
# def area_square(side):
#     return side * side

# def area_circle(radius):
#     import math
#     return math.pi * radius * radius
# # ```

# # 2. File: `main.py`

# # ```python
# import shapes

# print(shapes.area_square(4))
# print(shapes.area_circle(5))
# # ```

# # ---


# # importing modules in Python is a way to organize and reuse code effectively. Here’s a quick guide on how to create and use modules, along with some practical examples.


# # ```python
# if __name__ == "__main__":
# # ```

# # Let’s break it down in simple terms — with **clear explanation, analogy, and use cases**.

# # ---

# # ## 🧠 What is `__name__ == "__main__"` in Python?

# # In Python, every file (module) has a built-in variable called `__name__`.

# # * If the file is **being run directly**, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`.
# # * If the file is **being imported as a module**, `__name__` is set to the **module name** (i.e., filename without `.py`).

# # ---

# # ## 🧩 Analogy

# # Think of Python files as **TV channels**.

# # * When you're **watching directly**, it says: "You're watching *Live Now*" → `__name__ == "__main__"`
# # * When you're **recording the show to use later**, it doesn't say *Live Now*. It's just part of another collection → `__name__ != "__main__"`

# # ---

# # ## 💡 Why Use It?

# # ### ✅ To prevent some code from running **when the file is imported**.

# # Here’s a small example:

# # ```python
# # # file: math_utils.py

# def add(a, b):
#     return a + b

# # print("This runs no matter what")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print("This runs only when this file is executed directly")
#     print(add(2, 3))
# # ```

# # Now:

# # ### ✔ When you run this file directly:

# # ```bash
# # $ python math_utils.py
# # ```

# # Output:

# # ```
# # This runs no matter what
# # This runs only when this file is executed directly
# # 5
# # ```

# # ### ❌ When you import it in another file:

# # ```python
# # # file: main.py
# # import math_utils
# # ```

# # Output:

# # ```
# # This runs no matter what
# # ```

# # But it **does not run**:

# # ```
# # This runs only when this file is executed directly
# # ```

# # ---

# # ## 🧰 Use Cases

# # 1. ✅ Testing the script independently (e.g., testing functions)
# # 2. ✅ Creating reusable modules without unwanted execution
# # 3. ✅ Preventing side effects during imports
# # 4. ✅ Good practice for CLI (command-line interface) scripts

# # ---

# # ## 🛠 Real Project Use Example

# # ```python
# # # file: utils/logger.py

# # def log_info(msg):
# #     print(f"[INFO]: {msg}")

# # if __name__ == "__main__":
# #     print("Testing logger...")
# #     log_info("This is a test log")
# # ```

# # Now `logger.py` can be reused across projects, and still be tested alone.

# # ---

# # ## 🧠 Summary

# # | Action                    | `__name__` value |
# # | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
# # | File run directly         | `"__main__"`     |
# # | File imported as a module | `"module_name"`  |

# # ```python
# # if __name__ == "__main__":
# #     # this block only runs if the file is executed directly
# # ```
