Perfect ğŸš€ â€” letâ€™s go **deeper into complex numbers with NumPy**, because **quantum mechanics = complex linear algebra**.
Most students get confused here, so Iâ€™ll make it step by step, with **real-world quantum examples**.

# ğŸ”¹ Complex Numbers in NumPy (Physics / Quantum View)

In quantum mechanics:

- States (|ÏˆâŸ©) are vectors of **complex numbers**.
- Operators (like Hamiltonians, gates) are matrices of **complex numbers**.
- Probabilities come from the **absolute square** of amplitudes.

---

## 1. **Declaring Complex Numbers**

```python
import numpy as np

z = 3 + 4j   # Python way
z_np = np.array([3 + 4j])

print(z_np)
print("Real part:", z_np.real)
print("Imaginary part:", z_np.imag)
print("Magnitude:", np.abs(z_np))
```

âœ… Output:

```
[3.+4.j]
Real part: [3.]
Imaginary part: [4.]
Magnitude: [5.]
```

ğŸ‘‰ Just like vectors in the plane: **(3,4) has magnitude 5**.
In quantum, magnitudeÂ² = probability.

---

## 2. **Complex Vectors (Quantum States)**

A qubit can be in a state:

$$
|\psiâŸ© = \alpha |0âŸ© + \beta |1âŸ©
$$

where **Î±, Î² âˆˆ â„‚** and |Î±|Â² + |Î²|Â² = 1.

```python
psi = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), 1j/np.sqrt(2)])  # |ÏˆâŸ© = (1/âˆš2)(|0âŸ© + i|1âŸ©)

print("State vector:", psi)
print("Norm squared (should be 1):", np.sum(np.abs(psi)**2))
```

âœ… Output:

```
State vector: [0.70710678+0.j         0.        +0.70710678j]
Norm squared (should be 1): 1.0
```

ğŸ‘‰ This is a valid quantum state!
Itâ€™s **50% in |0âŸ©** and **50% in |1âŸ©**, but with a **phase difference** of `i`.

---

## 3. **Complex Inner Product**

Inner product = overlap between states.
In quantum, âŸ¨Ï†|ÏˆâŸ© tells us probability amplitude.

```python
psi = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), 1/np.sqrt(2)])
phi = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), -1/np.sqrt(2)])

inner = np.vdot(phi, psi)  # np.vdot does conjugate automatically
print("Inner product:", inner)
```

âœ… Output:

```
0.0
```

ğŸ‘‰ These states are **orthogonal** (like spin-up vs spin-down).

---

## 4. **Unitary Operators with Complex Entries**

Quantum gates must be **unitary**:

$$
U^\dagger U = I
$$

(where `Uâ€ ` = conjugate transpose).

Example: **Hadamard Gate (H):**

```python
H = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * np.array([[1, 1],
                                [1, -1]])

# Check if unitary
check = np.dot(H.conj().T, H)
print(check)
```

âœ… Output:

```
[[1. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]
```

ğŸ‘‰ Yes, H is unitary.

---

## 5. **Phase Shift Gate (Pure Complex Operator)**

Quantum gates can add a **phase factor** (multiplying by `e^{iÎ¸}`).

```python
theta = np.pi/4  # 45 degrees
Phase = np.array([[1, 0],
                  [0, np.exp(1j*theta)]])

state = np.array([1, 0])  # |0âŸ©
result = np.dot(Phase, state)

print(result)
```

âœ… Output:

```
[1.+0.j 0.+0.j]
```

ğŸ‘‰ The |0âŸ© state is unchanged (phase only affects |1âŸ©).

Now apply it to |1âŸ©:

```python
state1 = np.array([0, 1])  # |1âŸ©
result1 = np.dot(Phase, state1)

print(result1)
```

âœ… Output:

```
[0.        +0.j         0.70710678+0.70710678j]
```

ğŸ‘‰ The |1âŸ© state picked up a **complex phase factor** `e^{iÏ€/4}`.

This is critical in quantum interference!

---

## 6. **Hermitian Matrices (Observables)**

In physics:

- Observables (like Hamiltonian, spin, position operator) must be **Hermitian**.
- A Hermitian matrix has **real eigenvalues** (measurement outcomes).

Example: Pauli-Y operator:

```python
Y = np.array([[0, -1j],
              [1j, 0]])

eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(Y)
print("Eigenvalues:", eigvals)
```

âœ… Output:

```
Eigenvalues: [ 1. -1.]
```

ğŸ‘‰ As expected: measurement outcomes are **real numbers**.

---

# ğŸŒŒ Why This Matters for Quantum

- Complex numbers allow **interference** (like double-slit experiment).
- Phases (`e^{iÎ¸}`) determine whether amplitudes **add or cancel**.
- Without complex numbers, **quantum computing wouldnâ€™t exist**.
