Perfect 👍 Let’s make a **step-by-step teaching roadmap for NumPy** so you can train your students from **zero to advanced** with logic-building in mind.

# 🛤️ Roadmap to Learn NumPy (Step by Step)

---

## **📍 Stage 1: Getting Started (Arrays vs Lists)**

🎯 Goal: Students understand what NumPy is and why we use it.

- **Explain:**

  - Python lists are slow for math.
  - NumPy arrays are **fast, memory-efficient, and allow vectorized operations**.

- **Teach:**

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  list_data = [1, 2, 3]
  array_data = np.array([1, 2, 3])

  print("List:", list_data)
  print("Array:", array_data)
  print("Array * 2:", array_data * 2)  # Works directly
  ```

- **Activity:** Compare list vs array in simple math.

---

## **📍 Stage 2: Array Creation & Basics**

🎯 Goal: Students learn how to create arrays in different ways.

- `np.array()` – from lists
- `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.full()`
- `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`

✅ Practice:

```python
np.zeros((2, 3))
np.ones((3, 3))
np.arange(1, 11, 2)
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
```

- **Mini-task:** Create a **temperature record** for 7 days (array of numbers).

---

## **📍 Stage 3: Indexing & Slicing**

🎯 Goal: Extract, modify data.

- Single element `arr[0]`, `arr[-1]`
- Slices `arr[1:4]`, `arr[:, 0]` (for 2D arrays)
- Boolean indexing `arr[arr > 50]`

✅ Task:

- Given marks of 5 students, print only those > 50.

---

## **📍 Stage 4: Array Operations**

🎯 Goal: Perform element-wise & matrix operations.

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Dot product (`@`)
- Broadcasting rules

✅ Task:

- Add sales of Shop A & Shop B (2×2 arrays).
- Multiply price & quantity to get revenue.

---

## **📍 Stage 5: Statistical Functions**

🎯 Goal: Summaries from data.

- `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`, `np.std()`

✅ Task:

- Given 1 week of temperatures, find average, max, min.

---

## **📍 Stage 6: Reshaping & Combining**

🎯 Goal: Students learn to restructure data.

- `reshape()`
- `hstack()`, `vstack()`
- `concatenate()`

✅ Task:

- Reshape a 1D array of 12 months into `3x4` (quarters).

---

## **📍 Stage 7: Linear Algebra**

🎯 Goal: Introduce DSA/Math side of NumPy.

- Transpose (`.T`)
- Determinant, Inverse
- Solve linear equations (`np.linalg.solve`)

✅ Task:

- Solve 2 equations:
  `3x + 2y = 18`
  `x + y = 8`

---

## **📍 Stage 8: Real-World Applications**

🎯 Goal: Show how NumPy is used in real life.

- **Physics:** `F = m * a` (vectorized)
- **Economics:** Calculate profit = revenue – cost
- **Image Processing:** Represent grayscale image as 2D array and manipulate brightness

✅ Task:

- Create a **random 3×3 matrix** as an “image” and increase brightness by +50.

---

## **📍 Stage 9: Advanced (Optional for Bright Students)**

- Random numbers (`np.random`)
- Masking data (boolean operations)
- Vectorization vs loops (performance test)

✅ Task:

- Generate 100 random exam scores, find how many passed (> 50).
