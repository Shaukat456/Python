Perfect! 🚀 Let’s now dive into **Matrix Operations in NumPy** step by step.
This is where NumPy really shines, because handling **matrices with pure Python lists** is very slow and messy.

# 🧮 Matrix Operations in NumPy

## 🔍 Step 1: Creating Matrices

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Matrix B:\n", B)
```

👉 Output:

```
Matrix A:
 [[1 2]
  [3 4]]
Matrix B:
 [[5 6]
  [7 8]]
```

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Matrix Addition & Subtraction

```python
print(A + B)   # element-wise addition
print(A - B)   # element-wise subtraction
```

👉 Output:

```
[[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]

[[-4 -4]
 [-4 -4]]
```

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Matrix Multiplication

There are **two types**:

### 1. Element-wise Multiplication (`*`)

```python
print(A * B)
```

👉 Output:

```
[[ 5 12]
 [21 32]]
```

### 2. Dot Product (`@` or `np.dot`)

```python
print(A @ B)         # or np.dot(A, B)
```

👉 Output:

```
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```

⚡ Real-world analogy:

* **Element-wise** = multiplying cost of each item with quantity.
* **Dot product** = combining weights & values (like grades × credits).

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Transpose of a Matrix

```python
print(A.T)
```

👉 Output:

```
[[1 3]
 [2 4]]
```

Transpose = flipping rows ↔ columns.
📖 Example: student scores table → switching students & subjects.

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Determinant & Inverse

```python
print(np.linalg.det(A))   # Determinant
print(np.linalg.inv(A))   # Inverse
```

👉 Output:

```
-2.0000000000000004
[[-2.   1. ]
 [ 1.5 -0.5]]
```

⚡ Inverse matrix is like the **undo button** for matrix multiplication.

---

## 🔍 Step 6: Identity Matrix

```python
I = np.eye(2)
print(I)
```

👉 Output:

```
[[1. 0.]
 [0. 1.]]
```

👉 Rule: `A @ I = A` (like multiplying a number with 1).

---

## 🔍 Step 7: Solving Linear Equations

Example: Solve

```
2x + y = 5  
x + y = 3
```

We can write it as `AX = B`:

```python
A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 1]])
B = np.array([5, 3])

X = np.linalg.solve(A, B)
print(X)
```

👉 Output:

```
[2. 1.]
```

✅ Solution: `x = 2, y = 1`

---

## 🔍 Step 8: Real-World Example (Physics)

Force = Mass × Acceleration

```python
mass = np.array([[60, 70], [80, 90]])        # kg
acceleration = np.array([[2], [3]])          # m/s²

force = mass @ acceleration
print(force)
```

👉 Output:

```
[[260]
 [350]]
```

Each row shows **force** for different combinations.

---

🔥 Now you know:

* Addition, Subtraction
* Multiplication (element-wise & dot product)
* Transpose
* Determinant & Inverse
* Identity Matrix
* Solving Linear Equations
