Perfect 👌 Let’s dive into **Reshaping & Combining in NumPy** step by step.
I’ll explain with **real-world examples** so it makes sense beyond just numbers.

---

# 🔹 1. Reshaping Arrays

👉 **Why Reshape?**
Reshaping changes the “view” of data without changing the actual elements.

---

### 🧮 Example 1: Reshape Student Scores

Suppose you have **6 student scores** in one array:

```python
import numpy as np

scores = np.array([85, 90, 78, 88, 92, 95])
print(scores.shape)   # (6,)
```

But you want to arrange them as a **2D table (2 rows, 3 columns):**

```python
reshaped = scores.reshape(2, 3)
print(reshaped)
```

✅ Output:

```
[[85 90 78]
 [88 92 95]]
```

👉 This looks like a classroom record: 2 rows (batches), 3 columns (students).

---

### 🧮 Example 2: Image Data

A grayscale image is just numbers (pixel intensities).
A **28x28 image** (like in MNIST dataset) is stored as a **1D array of 784 values**.
To view it as an image, you **reshape** it:

```python
pixels = np.arange(784)   # fake image
image = pixels.reshape(28, 28)
```

👉 Without reshaping → it’s just a line of numbers.
👉 With reshaping → it becomes a proper **28x28 matrix (image)**.

---

### 📌 Key Reshape Functions

* `reshape(rows, cols)` → change shape
* `ravel()` → flatten into 1D (view)
* `flatten()` → flatten into 1D (copy)

---

# 🔹 2. Combining Arrays

👉 **Why Combine?**
Sometimes you need to merge multiple datasets into one.

---

### 🧮 Example 3: Student Marks in Two Subjects

```python
math = np.array([85, 90, 78])
science = np.array([88, 92, 95])
```

Combine **horizontally** (side by side, like columns):

```python
combined = np.column_stack((math, science))
print(combined)
```

✅ Output:

```
[[85 88]
 [90 92]
 [78 95]]
```

👉 Looks like a report card: each row = student, columns = subjects.

---

### 🧮 Example 4: Stack Vertically

Suppose you have **two classes’ scores**:

```python
classA = np.array([85, 90, 78])
classB = np.array([88, 92, 95])
```

Stack **vertically** (like rows in a table):

```python
vstacked = np.vstack((classA, classB))
print(vstacked)
```

✅ Output:

```
[[85 90 78]
 [88 92 95]]
```

👉 Each row = one class.

---

### 🧮 Example 5: Joining Sensor Data

Imagine you have temperature readings from **two sensors**:

```python
sensor1 = np.array([22.5, 23.0, 22.8])
sensor2 = np.array([24.1, 23.5, 23.8])
```

Merge into one dataset (horizontal):

```python
data = np.hstack((sensor1, sensor2))
print(data)
```

✅ Output:

```
[22.5 23.0 22.8 24.1 23.5 23.8]
```

👉 Useful when preparing combined datasets for **machine learning**.

---

# 🔹 3. Splitting Arrays (Opposite of Combining)

Sometimes you also need to **split** an array:

```python
arr = np.array([10,20,30,40,50,60])
split_arr = np.split(arr, 3)
print(split_arr)
```

✅ Output:

```
[array([10, 20]), array([30, 40]), array([50, 60])]
```

👉 Example: Splitting data into **training / validation / testing** sets.

# 🔑 Real-World Uses

* **Reshape**

  * Images (1D → 2D/3D)
  * Time-series data into batches
  * Converting flat database rows into structured arrays

* **Combine**

  * Merge student marks from different subjects
  * Combine multiple sensors’ readings
  * Append datasets for machine learning
