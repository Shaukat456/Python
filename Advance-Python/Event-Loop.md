# 🧠 1. Simple Idea of Event Loop

Think of the **event loop** as a **smart manager** 🧑‍💼 who decides *“Which task should run now?”*

* In **sync code**, Python just executes line by line, no choice.
* In **async code**, there may be many tasks “waiting” (for I/O, timers, APIs, etc.).
  👉 The **event loop** checks which tasks are ready, runs them for a bit, then switches to another.

So the event loop = **task scheduler**.

# 🎬 2. Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **restaurant kitchen** 🍳:

* The chef (event loop) manages many dishes (tasks).
* If one dish is **boiling water** (waiting), the chef doesn’t stand idle — he works on another dish.
* He keeps rotating between dishes until all are complete.

That’s exactly how the event loop behaves.

# ⚙️ 3. Event Loop in Python

Python’s `asyncio` library provides the event loop.
You usually start it with:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

asyncio.run(main())   # starts the event loop
```

👉 Here:

* The event loop starts.
* Runs `main()` until it hits `await asyncio.sleep(1)` (waiting).
* Event loop checks: *“anything else I can do while waiting?”*
* After 1 sec, continues and prints “World”.

# 🔄 4. Dry Run (with Multiple Tasks)

```python
import asyncio

async def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Start {name}")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"End {name}")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        task("A", 2),
        task("B", 1),
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Event Loop Timeline:

1. Start A, Start B
2. Both hit `await asyncio.sleep(...)` → they pause.
3. Event loop sees: Task B is ready after 1s → resume B → prints End B.
4. After 2s, Task A is ready → resume A → prints End A.

Total time = 2s (not 3s).

# 🛠️ 5. Key Points

* Event loop = **scheduler** that decides which async task runs.
* It **runs until all tasks are finished**.
* Tasks can **pause** (`await`) and let others run.
* Without event loop → async code won’t work.

---

# ⚡ 6. Extra Tip

In **real apps** (like web servers, chatbots, or API calls):

* The event loop lets thousands of requests be handled **without creating thousands of threads**.
* That’s why frameworks like **FastAPI** or **aiohttp** use async heavily.
