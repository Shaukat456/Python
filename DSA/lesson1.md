## 🧩 LESSON 1: What is an Algorithm?

---

## 1️⃣ What is an Algorithm? (Core Idea)

### Definition (Simple):

> An **algorithm** is a **clear step-by-step method** to solve a problem.

❌ Not magic
❌ Not only code
✅ It is **thinking + steps**

---

## 2️⃣ Real-World Analogy (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Example: Making Tea ☕

Ask students:

> “Can you make tea without steps?”

**Algorithm for Tea**

1. Take pan
2. Add water
3. Boil water
4. Add tea leaves
5. Add sugar
6. Add milk
7. Pour tea

➡️ These steps = **Algorithm**

### Key Learning:

- Order matters
- Missing step = wrong result
- Same problem, different methods possible

---

## 3️⃣ Algorithm vs Program

| Algorithm            | Program                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Logical steps        | Code implementation     |
| Language independent | Language dependent      |
| Written in English   | Written in Python / C++ |

👉 **First algorithm, then code**

---

## 4️⃣ Real Programming Example

### Problem:

> Add two numbers

### Algorithm (English):

1. Take input a
2. Take input b
3. Add a + b
4. Print result

### Python Code:

```python
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)
```

➡️ Code is just **translation of algorithm**

---

## 5️⃣ Why Algorithms Matter? (Mindset Shift)

### Same Problem — Different Algorithms

#### Problem:

> Find a name in class

**Method 1 (Slow):**

- Check every student one by one

**Method 2 (Smart):**

- If roll numbers sorted → jump to middle

➡️ Both correct
➡️ One is **faster**

This is where **DSA starts**

---

## 6️⃣ Characteristics of a Good Algorithm

A good algorithm should be:

1. **Correct** – gives right answer
2. **Clear** – easy to understand
3. **Efficient** – saves time & memory
4. **Finite** – must end

---

## 7️⃣ First Student Algorithm (Class Activity)

### Task:

> Write algorithm to brush teeth

Expected Answer:

1. Take toothbrush
2. Apply toothpaste
3. Brush for 2 minutes
4. Rinse mouth

👉 Train students to **think in steps**

---

## 8️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Jumping to code directly
❌ No step thinking
❌ No idea about efficiency
❌ Writing random loops

Fix:

> “First **think**, then **code**”

---

## 9️⃣ Homework (Important)

Ask students to write **algorithms only (no code)** for:

1. Login to Gmail
2. Withdraw money from ATM
3. Cook rice
4. Search contact in phone

---

## 10️⃣ Teacher Tip (Very Important)

In class:

- **Never start with code**
- Start with **story / real life**
- Then dry-run on board
- Then Python code
